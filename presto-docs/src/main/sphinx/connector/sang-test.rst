What Sang did to add this to oss-presto git server to work on forked Presto

I had added VS Code and spent time on remote set-up and testing. But VS Code 
does have a leanring curve and will spend time on it later.

The current changes are from me ssh'ng into server and using vi to make edit.

I added "connector/sang-test" the connector.rst
then I created sang-test.rst file under connector folder  

Now I understand why all Websites look alike.. Everyone just copy and pasting

For example:

.. code-block:: none

 Not sure how this will render
